Test Input



This is test text input for use with a script that should convert this into an

HTML document.  Unfortunately, not every text document ends with a nice newline

the way a word doc pasted into a text doc works.  



For example, this document has paragraphs where each line within the paragraph

is separated by a newline character, but the newline does not indicate the 

start of a new paragraph.  Thus, text will have to be chunked into blocks based

on whether or not there are two consecutive newlines, which would likely

indicate the start of a new paragraph.



Conclusion



In conclusion, let's fire this baby up and see what happens...
