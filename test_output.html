<h1>Test Input</h1>
<p>This is test text input for use with a script that should convert this into an
HTML document.  Unfortunately, not every text document ends with a nice newline
the way a word doc pasted into a text doc works.</p>
<p>For example, this document has paragraphs where each line within the paragraph
is separated by a newline character, but the newline does not indicate the 
start of a new paragraph.  Thus, text will have to be chunked into blocks based
on whether or not there are two consecutive newlines, which would likely
indicate the start of a new paragraph.</p>
<h1>A gratuitous List</h1>
<p>Here's a list of things I like to eat:</p>
<li>1. Pasta</li>
<li>2. Pizza</li>
<li>3. Burritos</li>
<li>4. Dessert!</li>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>In conclusion, let's fire this baby up and see what happens...</p>
