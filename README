This module is for taking a text file and parsing it into html using some 
simple rules and parsing code.

It can be used for things like translating a word doc into an html doc (via
converting the word doc into a text file first), for purposes such as creating
Terms of Use or Privacy Policies.

It is extremely basic for the time being, and some of the rules are a bit 
contrived (for instance, to be tagged as a standalone element there MUST be
an empty line of space between text.  In other words,

| My List
| 1. Pizza
| 2. Dessert

will all show up as one <p> block under the current code.  To properly make
'My List' a header and the list items <li>, you must input:

| My List
|
| 1. Pizza
|
| 2. Dessert

Leaving a blank line of space tells the parser to begin a new text block, 
complete with its attenuant tags.

The module serves its main purpose of saving time marking up long text docs,
but it assumes there will still be a human eye verifying markup is correct
before anything is sent to a production server.

THIS MODULE WAS BUILT IN PYTHON 3.2.
